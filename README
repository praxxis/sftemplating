# What? #

This project is an interface between Kohana and the [Symfony Compoments templating library](http://components.symfony-project.org/templating/). 

# Why? #

Because I liked the syntax of the Symfony templating library!

# How? #

Just extend `Controller_sfTemplate` when creating your controller. The controller will try and guess the template file to use (it will default to `<controller>/<actionâ‰¥.php`)
